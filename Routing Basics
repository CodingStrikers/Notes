Activated Route is used for dynamic purpose.(applied in ts file)
Routing is also applied in ts file.
Router Link is used for static purpose.(applied in HTML file)

Router.navigate is similar to RouterLink.
EG To differntiate the two-

EG for RouterLink
<a [routerLink]="['/payment']">payment</a>

EG for Router.navigate

private r:Router
 this.r.navigate(['home']);

Either u use routerLink or router.navigate everytime we need to mention the path and component in Routing file otherwise
it will wont work.

RouterLink will show the path when u hover over the component icons.
We use router.navigate mainly for redirecting when a condition fails or succeeds.

PARAMETERISED ROUITNG
Non-parameterised routes take precedence over parameterised routes.

ACTIVATED ROUTE 
In this params.subscribe method is used to get the valaue of parmaters.
Activated route is mainly used to get the information from the URL.
Suppose their is an Email ID and password and when it matches User wants to display the records in dashboard 
then in that case we must use this to get the name from the url (BY GET METHOD )and then search it in the DB and
then send it to the angular.

Firstly we need to set the router.navigate to dashboard/:name from where we will use the Get method and
activated router is used to get the paramater.

Implicit Conversion Basics-

console.log("5"+"3") // Output 53
Here concatination takes places as + operator is being overshadowed by the concatenation.Its the only place where 
operator is not given more preference.

console.log("5"-"3") // Output 2
At this place the minus operator is preferred over the string opearation even though both are string but the minus
operator treat them as a no.

console.log('AS'-3) // Output NaN
Its a datatype for occurance of error of nos i.e. not a no.

console.log("5"-3) // Output 2
will consider 5 as a no(as minus operator) and 3 is a no ,Hence substraction

console.log('shashabk'-'gahlot') // Output NaN

var r=Number("213");
r is now a no as we have used number operator.It will only take the input as a string that is of format no or boolean,for
all other cases it will show an error.

var r=Number("deep");
An error of NaN;
